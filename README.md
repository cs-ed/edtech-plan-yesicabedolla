# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is to introduce students to foundational skills that will help them succeed in future high shcool courses. Many, if not all, of our students have never had any sort of computer science class. 

## Context
This will be an elective class for students grades 6-8 that will meet daily for 30 minutes for the length of one trimester. 

### Course

Introduction to Coding for Middle School
Students will learn block coding using Scratch to solve different types of problets
as well as create a game project as their final project.
This course is open to middle school grade students with no prior experience or courses required. 
This course will focus on introductory coding for middle school students using Scratch as the platform.
We will learn to use:
-variables
-(forever) loops
-if statements
-multiples sprites
-customizing colors and backgrounds

### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

Sunnyside is a single school district grades K-8 and they also have a state funded preschool on site as well. Enrollment is 368 of which 88.6% Hispanic or Latino, 10.9% White and 0.5% Asian. Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7%. English Learners 46.7%
and has a Foster Youth of 2.2%. The Academic performance in Mathematics for this school is 102.9 points below standard compared to the state that is 33.5 points below standard. This is going to influence the difficulty of the course.

Being Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7% I know that not all students have a internet access outside of school even if they do it is not a very great connect beacuse internet providers are limited in the area. All students have a school issued chromebooks as we are a one to one school.
