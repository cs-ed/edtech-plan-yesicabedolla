# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is to introduce students to foundational skills that will help them succeed in future high shcool courses. Many, if not all, of our students have never had any sort of computer science class. 

## Context
This will be an elective class for students grades 6-8 that will meet daily for 30 minutes for the length of one trimester. 

### Course

Introduction to Coding for Middle School
Students will learn block coding using Scratch to solve different types of problets
as well as create a game project as their final project.
This course is open to middle school grade students with no prior experience or courses required. 
This course will focus on introductory coding for middle school students using Scratch as the platform.
We will learn to use:
-variables
-(forever) loops
-if statements
-multiples sprites
-customizing colors and backgrounds

### Situation

Sunnyside is a single school district grades K-8 and they also have a state funded preschool on site as well. Enrollment is 368 of which 88.6% Hispanic or Latino, 10.9% White and 0.5% Asian. Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7%. Free/Reduced Lunch 48.1 %. English Learners 46.7%
and has a Foster Youth of 2.2%. The Academic performance in Mathematics for this school is 102.9 points below standard compared to the state that is 33.5 points below standard. This is going to influence the difficulty of the course. 

Being Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7% I know that not all students have a internet access outside of school even if they do it is not a very great connect beacuse internet providers are limited in the area. All students have a school issued chromebooks as we are a one to one school.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Every student's operating system will be the same since all students are provided a school device.

I plan to use https://scratch.mit.edu/ "Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations."
-Students will create an account on Scratch, solve different types of problets, create a final project and share.

Google Classroom
Here I will post the assignments such as the problets and final project that students will complete on Scratch. Students will have to share thier link after they have made it sharable on thier Scratch account and submit here for grading. Here is where i will also post the grading rubric so that students will know what is required to get a passing grade on the work they are completing. 

### Hardware Specifications

Student chromoebooks have:
Processor Intel Celeron N2840, (2.16 GHz, Turbo up to 2.58 GHz, 1 MB 1333 MHz L2 cache, 2 cores)
Graphcs Intel HD Graphics 
4gb of RAM and 16gb of storage
Webcam
Chrome OS and its default set of apps
Power supply HP 45 W Smart AC Adapter

The computer that I will be using has:
Storage capacity 237 GB
Processor	AMD Ryzen 7 3700U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx     2.30 GHz
Installed RAM	12.0 GB (9.92 GB usable)
System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Pen and touch	Touch support with 10 touch points
Edition	Windows 10 Home
Version	21H1
Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 
Webcam

Classroom tech such as three LG - 55"- LED - 1080p - Smart - HDTV Roku TVs  will be used to project my screen so that students can see what I am sharing during class lectures.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
