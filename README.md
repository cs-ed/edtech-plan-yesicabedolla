# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is to introduce students to foundational skills that will help them succeed in future high shcool courses. Many of our students have never had any sort of computer science class. Students be learn about a whole new world of coding. 

## Context
This course will focus on introductory coding for middle school computer science.

### Course

Introduction to Coding for Middle School
Students will learn block coding using Scratch to solve different types of problets
as well as create a game project as their final project.
This course is open to middle school grade students. 


### Situation

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
