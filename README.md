# Educational Technology Plan

The goal is to introduce students to foundational skills that will help them succeed in future high shcool courses. Many, if not all, of our students have never had any sort of computer science class. 

## Context
This will be an elective class for students grades 6-8 that will meet daily for 30 minutes for the length of one trimester. 
Class size will be between 15-20 students based on student interest.  

### Course

Introduction to Coding for Middle School
Students will learn block coding using Scratch to solve different types of problets
as well as create a game project as their final project.
This course is open to middle school grade students with no prior experience or courses required. 
This course will focus on introductory coding for middle school students using Scratch as the platform.
We will learn to use:
-variables
-(forever) loops
-if statements
-multiples sprites
-customizing colors and backgrounds

### Situation

Sunnyside is a single school district grades K-8 and they also have a state funded preschool on site as well. Enrollment is 368 of which 88.6% Hispanic or Latino, 10.9% White and 0.5% Asian. Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7%. Free/Reduced Lunch 48.1 %. English Learners 46.7%
and has a Foster Youth of 2.2%. The Academic performance in Mathematics for this school is 102.9 points below standard compared to the state that is 33.5 points below standard. This is going to influence the difficulty of the course. 

Being Socioeconomically Disadvantaged 86.7% I know that not all students have a internet access outside of school even if they do it is not a very great connect beacuse internet providers are limited in the area in which case they experience slow or limited connections from home. All students have a school issued chromebooks as we are a one to one school.

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Every student's operating system will be the same since all students are provided a school device.

I plan to use https://scratch.mit.edu "Scratch is a free programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations."
-Students will create an account on Scratch, solve different types of problets, create a final project and share.

Google Classroom
Here I will post the assignments such as the problets and final project that students will complete on Scratch. Students will have to share thier link after they have made it sharable on thier Scratch account and submit here for grading. Here is where i will also post the grading rubric so that students will know what is required to get a passing grade on the work they are completing. 

Goguardian
I will use goguardian to help monitor the students as they work to problem solve and complete assignments. I will also use it to minimize the student contact during this COVID-19 era. 

Aeries Student Information System
Here I will input attandance for eachs student as well as use thier gradebook for term of the course. 

Zoom
If we need to return to distance learning, I will use Zoom meetings to hold classes for students since our district has coninuted to pay for those accounts. Students are already familiar with the platform since that is what we were using schoolwide during the last school year. 

### Hardware Specifications

Student chromoebooks have:
Processor Intel Celeron N2840, (2.16 GHz, Turbo up to 2.58 GHz, 1 MB 1333 MHz L2 cache, 2 cores)
Graphcs Intel HD Graphics 
4gb of RAM and 16gb of storage
Webcam
Chrome OS and its default set of apps
Power supply HP 45 W Smart AC Adapter

The computer that I will be using has:
Storage capacity 237 GB
Processor	AMD Ryzen 7 3700U with Radeon Vega Mobile Gfx     2.30 GHz
Installed RAM	12.0 GB (9.92 GB usable)
System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor
Pen and touch	Touch support with 10 touch points
Edition	Windows 10 Home
Version	21H1
Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 
Webcam

Classroom technology: three LG - 55"- LED - 1080p - Smart - HDTV Roku TVs  will be used to project my screen so that students can see what I am sharing during class lectures.

### Application.

We do not have a dedicated computer lab so I will be using my math classroom as the place of meeting. I plan on using Peer instruction. We will first start with smaller problets that students can solve in a class session. After students have solved problet, I will gather student responces. Then class is broken up into pairs or small groups to disscuss why their repsonce was a good answer, ot nessicarly to be wrong or right but just what they think is a good idea. Collect responces again from groups and finally teacher will faciliate disscussion and answer questions and give rational as to why some answers are right and some are wrong. 
Once students have a solve a few problets then they will be assigned a game project as their final project for the class. In the same way as problets were presented, the project will run the same route where they start by themselves, move to pairs/small groups, and finally whole class disscussions. 

Homework for this class will be pretty much nonexistent because of the inpact of being in a district that is 86.7% socioeconomically disadvantaged and lack of internet providers in the area. I will make sure that students have enough time during regular class sessions to complete all assignments and if need be I am available after school hours for those needing the extra time. 

Assignments will be submitted by sharing a link from Scratch on Google Classroom and I will input their grades in Aeries.

### Impacts

Students that pass this course will be able to apply their skills to future courses when they attend high school. As a part of Porterville Unifed School District, PUSD, there is a CODE pathway that 8th grade students can apply for. This high school pathway gives students a chance at experiencing a wide variety of hands-on projects. Here is what they have listed on their site, "In the CODE Academy, students gain hands-on experience in the areas of coding, cyber-security and computer application technology. Students complete projects by using Photoshop, creating mobile apps, programming robotics, developing web-based games, practicing cyber-security, and solving real-world problems. The CODE Academy uses Project Lead The Way curriculum." This course will help any student that wishes to apply to the CODE pathway in that they will be on step ahead because they will already be exposed to some basic skills needed to be successful.
